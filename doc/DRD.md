# Design Requirements Document (DRD)

## System Architecture

The evaluation pipeline is designed with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and extensibility. The main components are:

1. Configuration Module
2. Model Management Module
3. Data Processing Module
4. Evaluation Module
5. Experiment Tracking Module
6. Utility Module

## Module Specifications

### 1. Configuration Module (app/config.py)
- Define global variables and constants
- Manage environment variables
- Set up paths for model and dataset storage

### 2. Model Management Module (app/utils/model_loader.py, models/quantization.py)
- Implement functions to load pre-trained SegFormer models
- Apply quantization techniques (float8, int8, int4, int2)
- Manage model storage and retrieval

### 3. Data Processing Module (app/utils/data_processing.py)
- Implement dataset loading and preprocessing functions
- Handle data sharding for efficient processing
- Convert images and annotations to appropriate formats

### 4. Evaluation Module (app/utils/evaluator.py)
- Implement the main evaluation loop
- Calculate and aggregate evaluation metrics
- Handle batch processing of data

### 5. Experiment Tracking Module (app/utils/wandb_utils.py)
- Initialize and manage Weights & Biases runs
- Log metrics, model metadata, and performance data
- Create visualizations for result analysis

### 6. Utility Module (app/utils/general_utils.py)
- Implement helper functions for data conversion
- Provide utility functions for file management and error handling

## Data Flow

1. Configuration is loaded and environment is set up
2. Pre-trained model is loaded and quantized
3. Dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and sharded
4. Evaluation loop processes data in batches:
   a. Data is fed through the model
   b. Predictions are generated
   c. Metrics are calculated
5. Results are logged to Weights & Biases
6. Process repeats for each quantization method

## Interface Design

The system will primarily be used through a command-line interface. The main entry point will be `main.py`, which will coordinate the execution of all modules.

## Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline
- Use Python's logging module for consistent log output
- Integrate error reporting with Weights & Biases for centralized monitoring

## Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys)
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing system information in stack traces

## Scalability and Performance

- Design the system to efficiently utilize available GPU resources
- Implement data sharding to handle large datasets
- Use batch processing to optimize memory usage and computation time

## Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual modules
- Create integration tests for the entire pipeline
- Use a small subset of the dataset for quick testing and debugging

## Deployment Considerations

- Provide clear documentation for setting up the environment and dependencies
- Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment across different systems
