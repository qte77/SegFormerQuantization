# User Story

**Title:** Efficient Model Quantization and Evaluation for SegFormer

**As a** Machine Learning Engineer working on semantic segmentation tasks,

**I want** to have a streamlined pipeline for loading, quantizing, and evaluating SegFormer models,

**So that** I can quickly assess the performance impact of different quantization methods on model accuracy and efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Model Loading:**

   - The system should load pre-trained SegFormer models from a specified path or URL.
   - It should support loading models with different quantization levels (float8, int8, int4, int2).
   - The loading process should be logged, including time taken and memory footprint.

2. **Quantization:**

   - Implement functions to apply quantization techniques to the loaded models.
   - Ensure that quantization does not significantly degrade model performance.
   - Provide options for different quantization methods and allow for easy switching between them.

3. **Dataset Handling:**

   - Load and preprocess the Scene Parse 150 dataset or any other specified dataset for semantic segmentation.
   - Implement data sharding to manage large datasets efficiently, allowing for batch processing.
   - Convert images and annotations into the required format for model input.

4. **Evaluation:**

   - Run the quantized models on the dataset to generate predictions.
   - Calculate key metrics like mean IoU, mean accuracy, and overall accuracy.
   - Log these metrics to Weights & Biases for tracking and visualization.

5. **Performance Metrics:**

   - Track and report the inference speed for each quantization level.
   - Compare the memory footprint of the original model versus quantized versions.

6. **Configuration:**

   - Allow for configuration of model paths, dataset paths, quantization methods, and evaluation parameters through a configuration file (`config.py`).

7. **Error Handling and Logging:**

   - Implement comprehensive error handling to manage issues like model loading failures, dataset processing errors, or quantization issues.
   - Use Python's logging module to log all operations, errors, and performance metrics.

8. **User Interface:**

   - Provide a command-line interface for running the evaluation pipeline, allowing users to specify which quantization methods to test, dataset to use, etc.

9. **Documentation:**

   - Include detailed documentation on how to set up the environment, run the pipeline, and interpret the results.

10. **Testing:**

    - Ensure unit tests are in place for each module to verify functionality.
    - Integration tests should cover the entire pipeline from model loading to evaluation.

## Out of Scope

   - Training new models or fine-tuning existing ones.
   - Real-time processing or deployment of models in production environments.

## Additional Notes

   - The system should be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion to include other models or datasets.
   - Consideration for security, especially in handling API keys for Weights & Biases, should be integrated into the design.
