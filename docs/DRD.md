# Design Requirements Document (DRD)

## System Architecture

The evaluation pipeline is designed with a modular architecture to ensure flexibility and extensibility. The main components are:

1. **Configuration Module** (`src/config.py`)
   - Define global variables and constants
   - Manage environment variables
   - Set up paths for model and dataset storage

2. **Model Management Module** (`src/utils/model_loader.py`, `src/utils/quantization.py`)
   - Implement functions to load pre-trained SegFormer models
   - Apply quantization techniques (float8, int8, int4, int2)
   - Manage model storage and retrieval

3. **Data Processing Module** (`src/utils/data_processing.py`)
   - Implement dataset loading and preprocessing functions
   - Handle data sharding for efficient processing
   - Convert images and annotations to appropriate formats

4. **Evaluation Module** (`src/utils/evaluator.py`)
   - Implement the main evaluation loop
   - Calculate and aggregate evaluation metrics
   - Handle batch processing of data

5. **Experiment Tracking Module** (`src/utils/wandb_utils.py`)
   - Initialize and manage Weights & Biases runs
   - Log metrics, model metadata, and performance data
   - Create visualizations for result analysis

6. **Utility Module** (`src/utils/general_utils.py`)
   - Implement helper functions for data conversion
   - Provide utility functions for file management and error handling

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration is loaded and environment is set up**
   - Configuration parameters are read from `src/config.py`.

2. **Pre-trained model is loaded and quantized**
   - Models are loaded using `src/utils/model_loader.py`.
   - Quantization is applied using `src/utils/quantization.py`.

3. **Dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and sharded**
   - Dataset loading and preprocessing are handled by `src/utils/data_processing.py`.

4. **Evaluation loop processes data in batches:**
   - Data is fed through the model (`src/utils/evaluator.py`).
   - Predictions are generated.
   - Metrics are calculated.

5. **Results are logged to Weights & Biases**
   - Logging is managed by `src/utils/wandb_utils.py`.

6. **Process repeats for each quantization method**
   - The evaluation pipeline iterates through different quantization levels.

## Interface Design

The system will primarily be used through a command-line interface. The main entry point will be `src/__main__.py`, which will coordinate the execution of all modules.

## Error Handling and Logging

- Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the pipeline.
- Use Python's logging module for consistent log output.
- Integrate error reporting with Weights & Biases for centralized monitoring.

## Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing system information in stack traces.

## Scalability and Performance

- Design the system to efficiently utilize available GPU resources.
- Implement data sharding to handle large datasets.
- Use batch processing to optimize memory usage and computation time.

## Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual modules.
- Create integration tests for the entire pipeline.
- Use a small subset of the dataset for quick testing and debugging.

## Deployment Considerations

- Provide clear documentation for setting up the environment and dependencies.
- Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment across different systems.
