   - Calculate evaluation metrics (mean IoU, mean accuracy, overall accuracy)
   - Process evaluation in batches for efficiency

4. Experiment Tracking
   - Initialize and manage Weights & Biases runs
   - Log model performance metrics and metadata
   - Create visualizations for easy comparison of quantization methods

5. Utility Functions
   - Manage environment variables and configuration
   - Implement helper functions for data conversion and processing
